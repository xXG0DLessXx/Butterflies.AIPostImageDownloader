Repo for a very basic and simple script to download post images from profiles made on https://butterflies.ai

# How to use
- Clone the repo or download the script.
- Set the script to be executable
- Go to the user page you wish to download images from, scroll down untill all the posts from which you wish to download the image have been loaded, open your browser console and copy the entire HTML, paste it into a html file you made in the same directory as the script.
- Run the script with the html file path as the parameter for example:
```
./download_post_img.sh imagen_test.html
```
